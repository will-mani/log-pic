# log-pic
Encoding and decoding images using prime number pairs, log, addition, and factoring:

The standard image is 1000x1000, wich comprises of 1,000,000 pixels.
To encode such an image, gather togther the first 257,000,000 primes greater than a million.
There are 1,000,000 pixels, and each one has 256 possible values.
